The Sleep Disorder Prediction System is a web-based application that analyzes user health and lifestyle data to predict potential sleep disorders.
This project uses machine learning techniques on a sleep health dataset to identify patterns and provide predictions through an interactive web interface.

The system helps users understand how lifestyle factors like stress, physical activity, BMI, and sleep duration impact sleep health.
